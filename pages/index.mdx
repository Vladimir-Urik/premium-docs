# Introduction

Hi! Welcome to the wiki page for my premium resources!
Here you should find all the things you might be missing to get your resource up and running,
like a list of permissions and commands! :D If you still have questions you can contact me/anyone
from the community here on the [discord](https://discord.gg/zj72haU7gN)!

## How to add something to this wiki?
This wiki page is opensource! We use [nextra](https://nextra.site/) and run on [NextJs](https://nextjs.org/)!
However, thanks to [nextra](https://nextra.site/), we use simple Markdown to write pages for documentation!
So if you want to add something open the [repository](https://github.com/Vladimir-Urik/free-resources-docs) and add whatever you want!
If you want to edit something and don't know where it is in the repository, there is an "Edit this page" link on the right
of every wiki page. It will redirect you exactly to the specific mdx file in the [repository](https://github.com/Vladimir-Urik/free-resources-docs)!
